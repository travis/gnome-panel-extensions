<h1>User Installable gnome-panel Extensions</h1>
<h2>Functional Specification<h2>
<h3>Travis Vachon</h3>
<h3>July 3rd, 2005</h3>

<p>
<em>Note:</em> The term "applet" will hopefully be replaced by 
something that sounds cooler. That would be nice. If anyone 
has any suggestions, I'd be glad to hear them. I have occasionally
used the term "GNOME panel extensions" to mean "New style GNOME panel
applets." Hopefully this will not cause too much confusion, but should
be fixed in a future draft. Thanks!
</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> This specification is not, by any means,
complete. Comments and revisions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This project will implement a new kind of widget to display on
the GNOME 2 gnome-panel that can be installed by an end user 
of GNOME.
<p>
Currently, users wishing to install new "applets" must have 
some knowledge of the inner workings of gnome-panel (that is, 
they must have some knowledge of bonobo .server files and 
also know the correct places in the file system to install 
various pieces of the applet). As a result, the main method
of applet distribution is inclusion in a debian package or 
RPM.
</p>
<p>
We would like to implement a system similar to Mozilla Firefox
and Thunderbird extensions, in which developers can easily
create a single, user executable(?<em> FIXME? </em>) file 
to install new applets.
</p>

<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>
Norm, a gardener, loves GNOME, and he especially 
loves the GNOME panel. Since switching to Linux a year ago, 
he has greatly appreciated the familiar concept of a "taskbar"
and desktop menus, but he also likes the easy customizability
and number of applets included with his favorite Linux 
distribution.
</p>
<p>
One day, Norm finds "The Gardener" on his favorite GNOME 
website. The Gardener is  a panel applet that will
let him monitor the PH of his garden from his wireless laptop.
This is great news for Norm, since he currently needs to go
outside to do this. Unfortunately, The Gardener is not included
in Norm's distribution packages, and the documentation on The
Gardener's website is absolutely atrocious.
</p>
<p>
Norm decides that his dream of easy PH monitoring will remain
just that. The next time he updates his operating system,
however, he notices a new feature in the GNOME panel "Add new applets"
dialog. 
</p>
<img alt="Add new applets dialog" src="addtopanel.png"/>
<p>
Norm clicks on "Get new applets" and is directed to a web
page with a list of GNOME panel applets including a new version
of The Gardener.<em> FIXME? </em> Norm clicks on a link for a new page with a 
detailed description of The Gardener and an "install" link.
Norm clicks on the install link and gets a dialog box
confirming that he wants to install The Gardener. Norm hits
"yes", and immediately sees "The Gardener" pop up on one of the
panels.
</p>
<p class="tech">
In later versions, it would be nice if the new applet appeared
on the panel that the user clicked on to get the context menu.
For the first version, however, it will probably just appear 
on the first (root) panel.
</p>
<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<p>
Toby, a power user who switched to Linux several years ago, 
has decided he'd like to get into developing for GNOME. As
a first project, Toby decides to write a simple gnome-panel
applet. He finds a good PyGTK tutorial, as well as some
specifics on writing gnome-panel applets. After a week of
reading and coding, Tony has a functioning applet which allows
users to interface with GardenPro brand PH monitors and display
the output from the device on the GNOME panel. 
</p>
<p>
Toby sets up a
nice website for his new applet, The Gardener, and makes a tar
file containing the source code and appropriate .server files.
Toby leaves brief installation instructions in an INSTALL file within
the archive, and submits the code to a maintainer for the 
gnome-applets package. The maintainer, unfortunately, doesn't 
think The Gardener really fits with the rest of the applets in
the package, and rejects poor Toby's submission. At about the 
same time, school starts and Toby's work load picks up. As 
a result, development on The Gardener essentially ceases.
</p>
<p>
A couple months later Toby reads about a new system for user
installable gnome panel extensions. Toby reads some information
on the new system, and easily converts The Gardener to the new
format manually. He then uses a utility to build The Gardener 
into a single file which he uploads to 
panelextensions.gnome.org. As part of the upload process, 
panelextensions.gnome.org gathers some information about
the file and creates an install link that users can click
on to install The Gardener. Hundreds of users use Toby's applet, to
rave reviews.
</p>
<p>
Toby is revitalized and becomes a code machine, eventually
leading the charge to make GNOME the premier desktop 
environment in the world.
</p>
<h4>Scenario 3</h4>
<p>
Norm (our now happy gardener) is approaching mid-life and decides he
no longer wants to be a gardener. In fact, Norm would like to
get rid of everything that reminds him of his old life, buy a
motorcycle and ride into the sunset. In order to do this, Norm would
like to remove The Gardener and install a new applet that displays
information about his bike via Bluetooth. 
</p>
<p>
Norm right-clicks on the
panel, selects "Manage applets" and is presented with a screen listing
all the applets Norm has installed from
panelextensions.gnome.org. Norm clicks on The Gardener and hits
delete. After a confirmation dialog, Norm gets a message that The
Gardener has been successfully removed from the system. 
</p>
<p>
Norm next finds his way once again to panelextensions.gnome.org and
finds exactly what he is looking for, an applet called "Big Bike
Bluetooth Buddy" (BBBB). Norm goes through the same process he went
through to install The Gardener and is happy to see BBBB pop right up
on his GNOME panel. Norm has a problem, however, since BBBB is
initially configured for a BabyBike 900, something Norm would never be
caught dead riding. Norm right clicks on the applet and selects
"Preferences" from the context menu that pops up. In a selection box
on the screen that pops up, Norm finds his KingHog 10000, hits
"OK" and is delighted to see information about his bike display on the
screen.
</p>
<h4>Scenario 4</h4>
<p>
After a couple years, the rough and tumble life of a biker begins to
wear Norm down. Wanting to settle down and retire, Norm decides to
become a professional open source developer. Since he's had such good
luck with GNOME, Norm decides to develop a GNOME panel applet to
display the size of his retirement account. Norm
finds a tutorial on developing GNOME panel applets that can be posted on
panelextensions.gnome.org and learns some Python and XML. 
</p>
<p>
Norm first writes a Python script to interface with his bank's online
banking system. He uses Inkscape to create a nice icon for his
applet and creates an appropriate .server file for bonobo. Norm then
creates a configuration file using XML which specifies the role of each
piece, including appropriate install locations and other relevant
information about how the pieces should work together.
</p>
<p class="open">
"other relevant information about how the pieces should work together"
is rather vague, and should be clarified. I would greatly appreciate
the input of anyone with some experience in this kind of this
regarding what kinds of information should be included in this kind of
configuration file. One thing I do want to try to do is keep the
configuration file as simple as possible. Listing each piece and a
little information about each piece should be just about right. The
question is, what kind of information? Thanks!
</p>
<p>
Norm now places all of the files for his applet into a directory and
runs the gnome-extension-bundle-builder (Gebb?). Gebb finds the
configuration file and packs all of the pieces into a single file,
probably either a zip file or an XML file.
</p>
<p class="tech">
We would like to be able to include any number of different types of
files in these bundles. Input on choice of bundle format (XML vs. zip
vs. ??) would be greatly appreciated.
</p>
<p>
Once Norm finishes creating a bundle, he uploads it to
panelextensions.gnome.org. The scripts on panelextensions.gnome.org
automatically detect some information about the applet and prompts
Norm for any information it would like that it cannot detect
automatically. 
</p>
<p class="tech">
Ideally Norm will be able to sign his applets before uploading them,
but this will probably not be present in the first version.
</p>
<h2>Non-goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
We will not provide 100% backwards compatibility. Existing applets will still 
use the current installation system, though ideally some of the 
existing applets will be ported to the new system. The first release
will not include ports of existing applets.
</li>
<li>
We will not support languages other than Python for the first
release. Using a scripting language for our applets will provide
excellent portability and make development easy. This will hopefully
encourage novel applications. Support for other languages can be added later.
</li>

<h2>Manage Applets Dialog</h2>
<p>
When Norm the GNOME user clicks on "Manage Applets" on the GNOME panel
context menu, he sees a dialog allowing him to manage his GNOME panel
extensions. 
</p>
<img alt="Manage applets dialog" src="manageappletsdialog.png"/>
<p>
From this dialog, Norm can delete applets from his computer, adjust
applet preferences (which he should also be able to do from the
context menu for the applet's display on the GNOME panel), view
a list of installed applets, and click on a button to access
panelextensions.gnome.org. 

</p>
<h2>Applet Structure</h2>
<p>
Applets will consist of three parts:
<ul>
<li>
Resource files like images, XML (glade files, schemas, etc), and
anything else developers would like to use.
</li>
<li>
A Python script. Future support could be added for other scripting
languages, but scripting languages will probably be the only ones
supported. Users should not need to have build tools installed to
install applets.
</li>
<li>
A "manifest," or some kind of file, probably written in XML, to tie
the pieces together and give instructions to the installer.
</li>
</ul>

Developers will need to simply place the files into a directory
together and run a utility that will examine the manifest and bundle
everything together into a single file (the installer). They will then 
be able to upload the installer to a central distribution site where
users can simply click on a link to the installer to have the new
applet appear on their GNOME panel.
