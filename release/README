GNOME panel extensions v0.0.1
August 27th, 2005
Travis Vachon

Currently, the system works like this:

1. Developer writes extension in Python and bundles it up using included build utility, gebb. See below for notes on gebb.

2. User acquires bundle file (bundlename.gpe) and puts it in ~/.panelextensions

3. User loads extension container applet through gnome-panel Add to panel... dialog.

4. User clicks on "Load Extension" button and double clicks on the extension he wishes to load.

5. Extension loads. Sweet.

See included tutorial and files for more information on creating bundles.
