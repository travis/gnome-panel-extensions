We are proud to announce the release of GNOME panel extensions v0.0.2!
</p>
<p>
GNOME panel extensions are a new type of object for the GNOME panel. 
Like the current applet system, panel extensions are designed to be easy
to write and integrate with GNOME. Unlike panel applets, however, panel 
extensions can be distributed and installed without the use of build tools
or package managers, and should work on almost any recent installation of
GNOME.
</p>
<p>
For more information on downloading and installing the panel extension system
please see the <a href="#download">Download</a> section below. For a tutorial 
on writing extensions, see <a href="doc/tutorial.html">Writing Panel Extensions</a>
</p>
<p>
Special thanks to Chris DiBona and everyone at the Google Summer of Code
program who provided seed and grant money that made this project happen.
</p>
<p>
Also, eternal gratitude to Havoc, Jonathan, and everyone at GNOME who
helped make this project a success.
</p>
<p>
Questions, comments, and bug reports can be sent to 06tfv[At]williams{D0t}edu
until a bugzilla site has been established.
</p>
<p>
Enjoy!
