We are proud to announce the release of GNOME panel extensions v0.0.1!
</p>
<p>
GNOME panel extensions are a new type of object for the GNOME panel. 
Like the current applet system, panel extensions are designed to be easy
to write and integrate with GNOME. Unlike panel applets, however, panel 
extensions can be distributed and installed without the use of build tools
or package managers, and should work on almost any recent installation of
GNOME.
</p>
<p>
For more information on downloading and installing the panel extension system
please click on "Download" on the left. To download extensions, click on
"Extensions".
</p>
<p>
Enjoy!
