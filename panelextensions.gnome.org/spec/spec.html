<h1>panelextensions.gnome.org</h1>
<h2>Functional Specification<h2>
<h3>Travis Vachon</h3>
<h3>July 5th, 2005</h3>

<p>
<em>Note:</em> "panelextensions.gnome.org" is a pretty ugly URL, and
should be replaced with something a little nicer. It would be nice to
keep the gnome.org domain, but "panelextensions" is kind of long. 
Suggestions would be very welcome!

</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> This specification is not, by any means,
complete. Comments and revisions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
panelextensions.gnome.org will serve as a showcase for GNOME panel
applets developed as specified in the "User Installable gnome-panel
Extensions", available at <a
href="http://wso.williams.edu/~tvachon/gpe/spec.html">
http://wso.williams.edu/~tvachon/gpe/spec.html</a> . Readers should be
familiar with this specification. 
<p>
This site will provide utilities for developers to upload single file
installation "bundles" created by the panel bundling utility. The site
will then display information about these applets and allow GNOME
users to install them by simply clicking on a link to the applet
bundle. Searching and other capabilities would be nice to add sometime
after the first release.
</p>
<p>
This site will eventually integrate with the look and feel of the
gnome.org domain, but the first release will not make this a goal.

<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>
Norm the GNOME user has just recently learned about the new applet
system for the GNOME panel. He'd like to see what kinds of sweet new
applets are available, so he directs his browser to
panelextensions.gnome.org and clicks on a link marked "Browse
Applets". By navigating through several categories of applets, Norm
finds LatteBuddy 1.0, a panel applet which displays the status of
Norm's Latte Machine. Norm clicks on a link for more information about
LatteBuddy and is presented with a screen listing detailed information
about which Latte machines LatteBuddy supports and other important
details about the applet. 
</p>

<p>
Norm decides this is one applet he cannot live without, so he clicks
on the "Install" link for LatteBuddy. After being presented with a
warning about installing software he does not trust, Norm is very
happy to see LatteBuddy pop up on his GNOME panel.
</p>
<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<p>
Toby, a GNOME developer, has created an applet installation bundle for
his new applet, LatteBuddy. He
directs his web browser to panelextensions.gnome.org and clicks on a
link labeled "Upload". Toby is then greeted with a screen prompting
him to log in or create a new (free) account. Since Toby does not
have an account, he clicks on "Register" and is presented with a page
asking for his user name, password, e-mail address, preferred
language, and optional real name and location. Toby enters the
requested information, hits submit, and is shown a screen indicating
that a confirmation e-mail has been sent to Toby's supplied e-mail
address. Toby opens his mail client and clicks on a link in the e-mail
he received from panelextensions.gnome.org. A new page opens up in
Toby's browser which prompts him to enter his user name and password
to log in.
</p>
<p>
Once he is logged in, Toby finds and clicks on the same "Upload" link
he clicked on when he first arrived at panelextensions.gnome.org. He
is then presented with a screen prompting him to enter or browse for 
the location of the applet installation bundle and pick one of a
number of predefined categories for his bundle. Toby enters the
information, clicks on a button marked "Upload!" and is presented with
a screen telling him that his bundle is being automatically verified
and processed. After several seconds, Toby is redirected to a page
with a confirmation message. Toby navigates back to the main page and 
is pleased to see his applet at the top of the "New Applets" list.
</p>

<h2>Non-goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
panelextensions.gnome.org will not, at least at first release, provide
a repository for old style panel applets. Providing links to sites
providing this kind of thing would probably be more appropriate at
first, and this feature may be considered at some later point.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Main Page</h2>
<p>
The panelextensions.gnome.org main page will provide, at minimum, a
set of links including "Upload" and "Browse". Eventually it will
provide listings of recently added, popular, and recommended applets.

<h2>Internal Site Structure</h2>
<p>
The top level directory of this site will contain a
<code>categories</code> which contains directories
corresponding to each of the applet categories provided by the site
and several utility directories like <code>style</code> (which will contain
stylesheets). 
</p>
<p>
When Toby uploads his applet bundle, he is prompted to select a
category for his applet from a list. Toby selects "monitors", enters
the location of his applet on his computer and hits
"Upload".
</p>
<p>
 The site will then use the applet
"manifest" (within the installation bundle) to get an applet name, 
in this case, <code>lattebuddy</code>. The site next creates a subdirectory of
the <code>monitors</code> directory named <code>lattebuddy</code>. 
</p>
<p class="open">
What categories should be present? I think something along the lines
of "Internet", "System Tools", "Time", "Weather", and a few more would
be good. Time and weather could probably be combined, but we should
have a few more. A good first choice could greatly increase the
usability of the site.
</p>
<p class="tech">
The category directory that an applet's folder resides in should be
<em> the only </em> factor determining which category the applet is
listed under on the site. This will allow for easy maintainability
(ie, it will allow applets to change categories easily), and is
important unless we want to specify a set number of categories
developers can classify applets in.
</p>
<p>
The site will next use an XML schema to verify (probably using an
existing verification service) the applet bundle Toby would like to
install. If the file is verified, it will be copied to the 
<code>lattebuddy</code> directory. If it is not, Toby will be
presented with an error message which will ideally include details on 
how to fix the problem.
</p>
<p class="tech">
This paragraph assumes we have chosen an XML format for the
installation bundles. If this does not happen, we should still do some 
form of verification, but the procedure for this will need to be
worked out.
</p>
<p>
The site will next use the applet bundle manifest to create an
information page which it will place in the <code>lattebuddy</code>
directory. The information page will include a description of the
applet, screenshots, and, ideally, an area to leave comments. For a
similar system, please see <a href="http://www.gnome-look.org">
