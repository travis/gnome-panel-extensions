<h2>Functional Specification<h2>
<h3>Travis Vachon</h3>
<h3>August 23rd, 2005</h3>

<p>
<em>Note:</em> "panelextensions.gnome.org" is a pretty ugly URL, and
should be replaced with something a little nicer. It would be nice to
keep the gnome.org domain, but "panelextensions" is kind of long. 
Alternatives I've thought of include: gpe.gnome.org and extensions.gnome.org.
Suggestions would be very welcome!

</p>
<p>
<em>Note:</em> This specification is not, by any means,
complete. Comments and revisions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
panelextensions.gnome.org will serve as a showcase for GNOME panel
extensions developed as specified in the "User Installable gnome-panel
Extensions", available at <a
href="http://wso.williams.edu/~tvachon/gpe/spec.html">
http://wso.williams.edu/~tvachon/gpe/spec.html</a> . Readers should be
familiar with this specification. 
<p>
This site will provide utilities for developers to upload single file
installation "bundles" created by the panel bundling utility. The site
will then display information about these extensions and allow GNOME
users to install them by simply clicking on a link to the extension
bundle. Searching and other capabilities would be nice to add sometime
after the first release.
</p>
<p>
This site will eventually integrate with the look and feel of the
gnome.org domain, but the first release will not make this a goal.

<h2>Scenarios</h2>
<h4>Scenario 1</h4>
<p>
Norm the GNOME user has just recently learned about the new extension
system for the GNOME panel. He'd like to see what kinds of sweet new
extensions are available, so he directs his browser to
panelextensions.gnome.org and clicks on a link marked "Browse
Extensions". By navigating through several categories of extensions, Norm
finds LatteBuddy 1.0, a panel extension which displays the status of
Norm's Latte Machine. Norm clicks on a link for more information about
LatteBuddy and is presented with a screen listing detailed information
about which Latte machines LatteBuddy supports and other important
details about the extension. 
</p>

<p>
Norm decides this is one extension he cannot live without, so he clicks
on the "Install" link for LatteBuddy. After being presented with a
warning about installing software he does not trust, Norm is very
happy to see LatteBuddy pop up on his GNOME panel.
</p>
<h4>Scenario 2</h4>
<p>
Toby, a GNOME developer, has created an extension bundle for
his new extension, LatteBuddy. He
directs his web browser to panelextensions.gnome.org and clicks on a
link labeled "Upload". Toby is then greeted with a screen prompting
him to log in or create a new (free) account. Since Toby does not
have an account, he clicks on "Register" and is presented with a page
asking for his user name, password, e-mail address, preferred
language, and optional real name and location. Toby enters the
requested information, hits submit, and is shown a screen indicating
that a confirmation e-mail has been sent to Toby's supplied e-mail
address. Toby opens his mail client and clicks on a link in the e-mail
he received from panelextensions.gnome.org. A new page opens up in
Toby's browser which prompts him to enter his user name and password
to log in.
</p>
<p>
Once he is logged in, Toby finds and clicks on the same "Upload" link
he clicked on when he first arrived at panelextensions.gnome.org. He
is then presented with a screen prompting him to enter or browse for 
the location of the extension installation bundle and pick one of a
number of predefined categories for his bundle. Toby enters the
information, clicks on a button marked "Upload!" and is presented with
a screen telling him that his bundle is being automatically verified
and processed. After several seconds, Toby is redirected to a page
with a confirmation message. Toby navigates back to the main page and 
is pleased to see his extension at the top of the "New Extensions" list.
</p>

<h2>Non-goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>
panelextensions.gnome.org will not, at least at first release, provide
a repository for old style panel extensions. Providing links to sites
providing this kind of thing would probably be more appropriate at
first, and this feature may be considered at some later point.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Main Page</h2>
<p>
The panelextensions.gnome.org main page will provide, at minimum, a
set of links including "Upload" and "Browse". A login box will also 
appear on the sidebar. This box will provide a text box for a username and
password, and will operate independently of the main page, that is, within 
an iframe tag. Eventually the main area of this page will
provide listings of recently added, popular, and recommended extensions.

<h2>Internal Site Structure</h2>
<p>
The site is currently scripted in Python using the mod_python apache module.
This allows for very fast and efficient request handling. See the mod_python
documentation for more information on the advantages of mod_python over
CGI Python scripting.
</p>
<p>
In the current implementation of this site, extensions and user information
are kept in DBM style databases as persistent Python objects. Eventually it
might be a good idea to switch to a mySQL or postgreSQL database system, but
for simplicity, this has been a reasonable approach.
<p>
When Toby uploads his extension bundle, he is prompted to select a
category for his extension from a list. Toby selects "monitors", enters
the location of his extension on his computer and hits
"Upload".
</p>
The site will then use the bundle's manifest.xml file to verify its validity.
If the site encounters problems verifying the file, it will display a helpful
error message.
If the file is verified, the site will create a Python "Extension" object 
which will include attributes for the bundle file name, 
extension name, extension description, owner (Toby), date of upload, and
other important information. The Extension object will also contain a 
"Category" attribute. This will enable us to easily classify and present
extensions once our database gets larger.

</p>
<p class="open">
What categories should be present? I think something along the lines
of "Internet", "System Tools", "Time", "Weather", and a few more would
be good. Time and weather could probably be combined, but we should
have a few more. A good first choice could greatly increase the
usability of the site.
</p>
<p>
Once the attributes of the Extension object have been properly set, the site
will store it in the extension database and place the bundle file in a "bundles"
subdirectory. 
</p>
<p>
When the site needs to display information about an extension, it gets the
Extension object from the database and accesses its attributes to build the
appropriate html.
